## About Me

My name is <strong>Tianshuo Peng (å½­å¤©ç¡•)</strong>. I am a 4th-year undergraduate student (Sep. 2021 - Jun. 2025) at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Zuchao Li](https://zcli-charlie.github.io/) and [Prof. Lefei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BLKHwNwAAAAJ). 
Currently, I'm a research intern in the [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Xiangyu Yue](https://xyue.io/) and [Bo Zhang](https://bobrown.github.io/boZhang.github.io/).

I will be joining the CUHK [MultiMedia Lab](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) as a PhD student in the fall of 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiangyu Yue](https://xyue.io/).

My research interests lie in multi-modal perception and understanding, especially vision-language understanding. My goal is to build an efficient, unified, and versatile intelligent system for understanding and generating content in any modality.

ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ I am open to any potential discussions or collaboration opportunities. If you are interested in my work or have any collaboration intentions, please feel free to email me without hesitation.
